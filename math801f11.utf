Amir Assadi: Notes from  Jernej
-----

Here are some ideas I came up with. 

We need to find some literature where these things are discussed/described. Wikipedia provides the starting point but more is needed.

Page http://www.recurrence-plot.tk/ seems to be a good source.

Names associated with recurrence plots: Norbert Marwan, Mamen Romano and Marco Thiel

Their paper: N. Marwan, M. C. Romano, M. Thiel, J. Kurths: Recurrence Plots for the Analysis of Complex Systems, Physics Reports, 438(5-6), 237-329. (can be downloaded from http://recurrence-plot.tk/marwan_PhysRep2007.pdf)

A website that has a lot of preprints, some of which are related to the topic:
http://www.math.uni-bremen.de/zetem/DFG-Schwerpunkt/

Poincare maps, recurrence
-------------------------

Two distinct terms:
   1) Poincare map (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_map)
       Given a lower-dimensional space R transversal to the trajectory
       (usually a plane), define a map that maps x to P(x) where P(x) is the
       point the trajectory ocupies the next time it hits R.

   2) Recurrence plot (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_plot)
       Compare x(t) to x(t') for different values of t and t'. This allows
       detection of periodicity and substructures.

Some ideas:
 1) Make the graphs thicker to allow for variation (Darwin-Poincare
 recurrence)

 2) Try to analyze these recurrence plots using various methods.
  *) with SVD: build a vector base of several different plots, then
    project others onto the base; the lengths of projections correspond to
    features
    *) extract some features as indicated in Recurrence quantification
    analysis (RQA)
    (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_quantification_analysis)
    *) some other methods - research needed

 Then train some network to do the classification; afterwards apply this
 to all the gene expressions (the mRNA traces) for all 7 different
 conditions. Try to figure out what kind of recurrence plots indicate
 lagging, suppression, independence, etc.

 3) With the above classifier, we can change the value of epsilon that
 defines the thickness (or variation) and check how much the recurrence
 plot type is stable w.r.t. changing the epsilon -> stability indicates
 biological importance

 4) One thing of interest would be the Taken's theorem to reconstruct the
 phase space. We could analyze stability wrt changing the dimensionality of
 the phase space.

 5) Poincare map stuff: create a combined trajectory for several mRNA
 traces in some higher dimensional space, then consider the recurence as
 they pass through some plane. Each mRNA curve is in its own dimension, the
 whole thing then lives on some kind of high-dimensional torus.

 6) For all of the above we should also consider normalizations, since the
 mRNA amounts seem to be diminishing with time. Normalize by first
 computing the envelope (based on maxima)

 7) How to deal with adaptation: the first 24 hours of measuring is right
 after the plants have been moved so they are still adapting to the new
 conditions. We should try to do classification based on the second 24
 hours.

* Dealing with license manager horrors

- diagnose whether license manager is running...  see instructions for manual start for os 10.6+

see: http://www.mathworks.com/support/solutions/en/data/1-18PYZ/index.html?solution=1-18PYZ
-----
For Unix/Linux/Mac OS X, the license manager is started and stopped through the terminal. For Mac OS X, Terminal can be launched from Applications/Utilities. Once you have a terminal window, the license manager can be started and stopped using the methods below:

==>  ==>  NOTE: For Mac OS X 10.6

there is a bug that prevents normal startup of the license manager. See the bug report here for more details:

http://www.mathworks.com/support/bugreports/581959
-----
Workaround

A bug in the FLEXnet license manager prevents the license manager scripts from starting the license manager on systems running Mac OS X 10.6.

To workaround this issue, start the license manager manually by executing the lmgrd binary, as follows:

Open Terminal from Applications/Utilities
Run the following command for a 64 bit Mac:
$MATLAB/etc/maci64/lmgrd -c $MATLAB/etc/license.dat -l /var/tmp/lm_TMW.log
where $MATLAB is the MATLAB installation location. For example:

/Applications/MATLAB_R2009b.app/etc/maci64/lmgrd -c /Applications/MATLAB_R2009b.app/etc/license.dat -l /var/tmp/lm_TMW.log
Run the following command for a 32 bit Mac:
$MATLAB/etc/maci/lmgrd -c $MATLAB/etc/license.dat -l /var/tmp/lm_TMW.log
where $MATLAB is the MATLAB installation location. For example:

/Applications/MATLAB_R2009b.app/etc/maci/lmgrd -c /Applications/MATLAB_R2009b.app/etc/license.dat -l /var/tmp/lm_TMW.log
Once started, the license manager will continue to run until the computer is restarted. The license manager boot scripts are also affected by this bug so you will not be able to start the license manager automatically. When you restart your computer, you will have to restart the license manager, as described above.
----- end bugreport

Option 1: Non-boot script method

1. Change directories in the terminal to $MATLAB/etc (where $MATLAB is your root MATLAB directory). For example, for R2009a on Mac OS X this will be /Applications/MATLAB_R2009a.app/etc and the command would be:
cd /Applications/MATLAB_R2009a.app/etc
2. To start/restart the license manager, use the lmstart script with the command:
./lmstart
3. To stop the license manager, use the lmdown script with the command:
./lmdown

NOTE: We recommend clearing the MathWorks log files found under /var/tmp before restarting the license manager under Unix/Linux/Mac OS X for versions of the license manager prior to 11.6.
----- end solution 

....so: in terminal run
/Applications/MATLAB_R2011b.app/etc/maci64/lmgrd -c /Applications/MATLAB_R2011b.app/licenses/network.lic -l /var/tmp/lm_TMW.log

* Wiping everything Matlab from my disk, rebooting. Installing 2011b with Brian Beck''s instructions in email today.

 - Notice from installer re compilers for Matlab Compiler 4.16; Stateflow 7.8:
 
-----1. You have installed the license manager, but it has not been started. Before running MATLAB, you will need to start the license manager. Reboot the machine or see the Installation Guide for instructions on how to manually start the license manager.  2. The following products require a supported compiler:  MATLAB Compiler 4.16 Stateflow 7.8  3. Simulink requires a C compiler for simulation acceleration, model reference, and MATLAB Function Block capabilities. It is recommended that you install a supported compiler on your machine.  4. Run mbuild -setup from MATLAB before using MATLAB Compiler or builder products.
